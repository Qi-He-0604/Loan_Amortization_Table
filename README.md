# Loan_Amortization_Table

Create an amortization schedule with user input of principal, minimum expected payment, interest, and extra payment. Compute the total payment, interest, as well as principal applied. 

For instance, a given 15-year $250,000 at an 8.0% interest rate, the monthly payment of $2,389.13 is expected over the 180 (15 years * 12 payments per year) payments. Please note that borrowers have the option to make an extra payment which will be applied to the principal. Extra payments will lower the principal and thus the loan can be paid in full earlier than expected.
